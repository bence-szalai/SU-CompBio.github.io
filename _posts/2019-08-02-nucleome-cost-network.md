We recently joined the [International Nucleome Consortium COST
Network](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA18127/) as MC members. The network will
work on understanding the 3 dimensional organization of the human genome, using
microscopy, biochemistry, and mathematical modeling, involving researchers with
a wide range of expertise, from biochemistry to mathematics. Nature Methods has
a nice collection of [recent
articles](https://www.nature.com/collections/rsxlmsyslk) on the topic.
